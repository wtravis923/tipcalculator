# tipcalculator
A simple C# program that allows a user to input the amount of their restaurant bill to see what their tip amount should be and then what the total of their bill would be with tip added.

Writing this program helped me understand the use of parsing data to manipulate it. For example, you take the user input, in this scenario their bill amount, as a string type. I had to then parse that string into a decimal so that I could calculate the tip percentage. Then, to format the tip amount and total amount into currency, I had to convert it back to a string. 

This program also introduces a menu with a while statement and switch case so that you could exit the program once you obtained the information needed.
